### How do I use this project?!?

The workflow proceeds in a few discrete steps:

1. Save the most recent version of the data set as a CSV in the `data` subdirectory.
2. Run the python script from within the `py` directory, probably with the following command:
```bash
python clean.py
```
This will convert the data into a JSON file that can be imported and adjusted for the front-end site.
3. Do whatever Aidan did in order to make this page, using the data site.
